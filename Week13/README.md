#### Struggles

I did have some defineate struggels with the (react-crud-rest-exercise-master) thursday assignment. I had a hard time getting started and needed quite alot of help to complete it. It made the entire thing even harder because it is the first virtual week. Not easy getting a hold of people to help..
