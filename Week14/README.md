> The assignment "Momondo like Servers" can be found in the "02-Th" folder.  

In this exercise we had to make 3 backends. However in part 5c, we were asked to merge the 2 into a third.  
That third one is called; "Thursday5c" and the appurtenant react app is called; "Thursday_frontend".  
However i didn't fully complete the 5e part.. I have commented out some parts of it in the code.  
We were told we didn't have to do the 5a to 5e part.
