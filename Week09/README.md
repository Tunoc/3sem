# Flow2Week1

### Tuesday:

> The assigenment "JPA RelationsGettingStarted" can be found in the "25-Tu" folder.  

My notes and answers for this assignment can be found in the project "jparelationshipsGettingStarted" in the customer class.
**Status for the assignment:** I did all the exercises, except from the last number 5.
I did start with it but never got to finish it. But the things that we needed to do in exercise 5 were also used in the wednesday
and thursdays assignments.

### Wednesday:

> The assigenment "restPersonsDto" can be found in the "26-We" folder.  

**Status for the assignment:** This exercise was meant for 3 days total. 2 of the days were Wednesday and Thursday this week, 
wich also is the reasoning behind there not being a Thursday folder. I completet everything, including all green, yellow and red exercises.
The only little part that i havent made was the Custom exceptions, because i allready had made trycatches on ym responses,
in the resource folder. The teacher said it was okay that i used this method, because i even got the same "Error codes and messages as the assignment asks for.
Even though this means that i'm not logging the exception that is thrown.
With that being said i did implement the "Generic Exception Mapper" for everything else that would "break" and throw an exception.  
**Be aware** that i have a seperate branch for the Red part of the last thing of this assignment with the Addresses.

### Friday:

> The assigenment "ExamPrep-JPA" can be found in the "28-Fr" folder.  

**Status for the assignment:** I did try to complete everything that was at least green in this assignment.
The reason that i only did greens here was because i didn't have enough time. Because i ran into an error that didn't make
sense for me; "on project ExamPrep-JPA: Fatal error compiling: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError:". After searching for it on
the web i came to the conclusion that it apparently had to be my; "JAVA_HOME" path that was the problem. But i don't see how that
could be the case since all my other projects work.
This is the reason why i tried my best to make the code for all the green questions, and i havent really made the Tester class
finished or correct because i wasn't able to build the project. I couldn't test or verify that whatever my methods did was correct.

#### Struggles
Probably the biggest struggle for me this week was getting the last Friday assignment done since there only are 24 Hours a day.  
If i had more time i would have tried with Making a completly new project and start over from scratch,
and see if i could make the code properly with a functioning tester class. However i did still try to make it "Blind".
