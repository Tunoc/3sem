# Week7:
Most of the assignments were made, the biggest problem was not having enough hours in a day.
All of the assignments were made. But at the end after friday somehow my dorplet from digital ocean stopped working.

There isn't a folder for each day because the Friday assignment was actually part of the monday-assignment and therfore both are in the same folder. Tuesday was also part of the same assignment as monday.

I'm putting some links to the repos of monday, because Travis-IC was used. But like i wrote up above there was something that went wrong between friday and saturday. And now i'm only able to see the index page and even if i make changes and commit/push it goes through Travis with a green color. But it dosn't update up on the droplet. I also tried manually deploying via mvn but it didn't work either. It somehow looks like the changes that i'm making to the program arent being pushed up onto the droplet.. Or it might not find the correct .war file to deploy? I'm uncertain.
I'm getting a Server 500 error whenever i go onto the deployed pages Api calls.
This link works fine (https://tunoc.codes/rest-jpa-devops-starter/).
However if we add the /api/movie/all.. It gives the error,(https://tunoc.codes/rest-jpa-devops-starter/api/movie/all).
I could not find a solution on this topic before we had to turn in the assignment.  
__But i belive that the code that i made should in theory work, as well as the fridays assignment - All cound at the following link.__

### Thursday 
The fetch assignment.
The first given api didn't work.
Therfore i used the chucknorris api and tried to use 2 different calls. Random and with a category.
I put the value into a table as asked.
