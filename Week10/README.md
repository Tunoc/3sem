My notes and answers for this assignment, 1-3, can be found in the "CORSandHOISTING" folder.  
**Status for the assignment:** I havent really done this assignment since i ran into something that looked like a bug to me.  
I managed to set up some basic things and even see the results in the browser.. However i wasn't able to see the results at all in postman.  
I ended up giving up after 2 hours of trying to get postman to work with this exercise, and no one that i asked was able to see why it shouldn't have worked.
Since i then wasn't able to use postman i went on with the friday exercises.

#### Struggles

I did have some defineate struggels with the thursday assignment. I did hovever start and get a little portion of the exercise done. I wasn't really able to do much though, because i couldn't use postman like we should according to the assignment.
I did set the nescesary; "Headers" and so on, in postman, and i'm able to use postman on other exercises and assignments. However that one didn't work out for me.
If i had more time i would have tried to entirely remake the exercise and try again from scratch, but there are only 24 hours a day :'P
